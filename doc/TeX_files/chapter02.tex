\chapter{Deployment}
The front-end expects the routes of both back-end server to be on the same domain as the front-end. This can be adjusted, with a complimentary same-origin-policy, or all servers can be put on the same origin via a reverse proxy, we recommend this solution. \\

To deploy the back-end you first have to setup the database. for this purpose we have a dump of our database delivered in the back-end folder. Our configuration was:\\
- DBNAME=CYSECPROJECT\\
- DBUSER=root\\
- DBHOST=localhost\\
- DBPASSWORD=testpassword\\
If you change this configuration you also have to reconfigure the servers.
After setup the database you can start the servers by executing the start.bat on windows or the start.sh. in the subfolders game/user.
If you want change some configuration, edit the startfile bevore executing it. You find a list of the propertys at the end of this chapter.\\
If starting the servers result in errors, please double check if all node modules are installed.
