\chapter{Project Structure and development}
The most intuitive seperation of work is the split in back-end and front-end.\\

The back-end consitst out of a database and two servers. One server for tracking user accounts (refered as userserver), and one for the quiz back-end (refered as gameserver).
Both Servers use the framework express and provide a REST API implemented in Node.js. We decided us for Javascript, as REST APIs are a typical usecase for it's usage.
Out of the scope of the project we made an admin UI in C\# using Unity3D, which we built for Android and Windows and which is also deployable on Linux and IOS. This part was the work of Andreas Hanuja.\\

The front-end is programmed using the react framework. This part was the work of Lenny HÃ¤ndler.\\\\

On both parts we helped each other with testing, finding and fixing bugs, application design and UI design. But in general we split the implementation and documentation work strictly to our scopes.
